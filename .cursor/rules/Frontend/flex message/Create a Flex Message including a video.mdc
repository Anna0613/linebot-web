#Requirements to include videos in Flex Messages
To include a video component in a Flex Message, you must:

Specify the type of a hero block as video.
Specify the size of the bubble to kilo, mega or giga.
The bubble isn't the child element of a carousel.
#Video aspect ratio
If your video is too wide or too tall, your video may not be displayed in full but cropped, depending on the device. To display your video properly, make sure the aspect ratio of all of these are the same:

The aspect ratio of the video specified in the url property
The aspect ratio specified in the aspectRatio property
The aspect ratio of the preview image specified in the previewUrl property
A video in a LINE chat room. A preview image with a 1:1 aspect ratio is displayed behind the video that has an aspect ratio of 16:9.

#URI actions for videos
Using the action property, you can specify a URI action. This action lets users open a URL in LINE's in-app browser or call a given number with the device's call app. The label for a URI action will be displayed in the following three places:

Chat room (after video playback)
Video player (during video playback)
Video player (after video playback)
A chat room when a video finishes playingA video player while a video is playingA video player when a video finishes playing

#Define a Flex Message with a video
The most basic layout of a Flex Message with a video is having the video only, as shown below.


You have to use the hero block to insert a video. To make Flex Messages with video appear well on LINE versions that don't support video components, specify alternative content. Specify the hero block's altContent property with the content to show instead of the video. The JSON definition of this Flex Message example is as follows.

{
  "type": "bubble",
  "size": "mega",
  "hero": {
    "type": "video",
    "url": "https://example.com/video.mp4",
    "previewUrl": "https://example.com/video_preview.jpg",
    "altContent": {
      "type": "image",
      "size": "full",
      "aspectRatio": "20:13",
      "aspectMode": "cover",
      "url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
    },
    "aspectRatio": "20:13"
  }
}
Flex Messages that contain only a video looks like video messages. With Flex Message, you can build a message with a video in more complex layout.


The JSON definition of this Flex Message example is as follows.

  "type": "bubble",
  "size": "mega",

#Playback behavior
You can play a video sent in a Flex Message from a chat room or with a video player.

 If the video doesn't play properly
Even if a message that contains a video is successfully sent, the video may not play properly on the user's device. For more information, see Why can't I play a video that I sent as a message? in the FAQ.

#Playback in a chat room
How the playback starts depends on the user's settings on LINE, at Settings > Photos & videos > Auto-play videos. Auto-play isn't supported on LINE for PC (macOS and Windows).

Settings	Video playback
On mobile & Wi-Fi	Video playback starts automatically
On Wi-Fi only	Video playback starts automatically only on Wi-Fi
Never	Video playback never starts automatically
#Screen when video playback finishes
When video playback finishes, you can have up to two buttons displayed over the video. The first one is Play that launches a video player when a user taps the button and starts playback. For more information, see Playback in a video player.

The second button is More information that shows the label for a URI action you specify in the video component. You can change the text. If you don't specify a URI action for the video component, only Play is displayed. For more information, see URI actions for videos.


#Playback in a video player
When the user taps a video in a chat room, a video player is launched and starts the video playback. The buttons you see during playback and after playback differ.

#Screen during playback
While a video is playing, you can have up to two buttons displayed at the top of the video player. The first one is Done that closes the video player when a user taps the button, and takes the user to the chat room. If the conditions for auto playback is met, the video playback continues in the chat room.

The second button is More information that shows the label for a URI action you specify in the video component. You can change the text. If you don't specify a URI action for the video component, only Done is displayed. For more information, see URI actions for videos.

Screen while a video is playing

#Screen when playback is complete
When video playback finishes, you can have up to two buttons displayed over the video. The first one is Replay that starts the playback again in the video player, when a user taps the button.

The second button is More information that shows the label for a URI action you specify in the video component. You can change the text. If you don't specify a URI action for the video component, only Replay is displayed. For more information, see URI actions for videos.

Screen when a video finishes playing

#Display on version of LINE that doesn't support the video component
If the version of LINE is lower than the version that supports the video component, the component specified as the value of the altContent property will be displayed. Use a box component or an image component for the altContent property.

#Videos in Flex Message Simulator
You can't preview a video on Flex Message Simulator. Instead, the alternative content you set is displayed in the preview area of Flex Message Simulator, like in Display on version of LINE that doesn't support the video component.

To check the video in Flex Messages you composed with the Flex Message Simulator, send the message from the simulator to your LINE. You can send a test message from the simulator with the Send... menu at the top right section of the Flex Message Simulator.
